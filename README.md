## AI Platforms & Tools

### Bulldog Genie

Evolved from an Alexa-style campus assistant into a GenAI-enabled, agentic infrastructure that supports institutional knowledge discovery, task guidance, and scalable service enablement. Bulldog Genie integrates enterprise systems, curated knowledge sources, and governance controls to deliver reliable, role-aware AI experiences for students, faculty, and staff.

*Bulldog Genie serves as the foundational backbone for digital transformation agents such as **TechVisor** and **Eduvisor**, enabling consistent architecture, shared governance, and reusable AI capabilities across multiple institutional use cases.*

**2025 Highlights**

- Expanded functionality, use cases, and adoption based on user feedback and evolving AI capabilities.
- Established a reusable GenAI infrastructure supporting multiple digital transformation agents.
- Implemented governance-aligned controls for trusted knowledge access and role-aware experiences.
- Built a scalable integration foundation for secure, enterprise-grade AI services.
- Adopted cloud-native DevSecOps practices to ensure repeatable deployments, security review workflows, and maintainable engineering operations.

## Strategy, Governance & Adoption

### FresnoState.ai Portal (https://www.fresnostate.ai)

Built as the institutional “front door” for AI at Fresno State, FresnoState.ai is a centralized portal that supports digital transformation by making AI services easy to discover, understand, and adopt responsibly. The portal connects governance, training, and tool access into a unified, scalable experience for the campus community.

**Highlights**

- Centralized AI tools, documentation, and governance guidance into a single source of truth.
- Improved AI readiness through onboarding workflows, training resources, and adoption support.
- Increased transparency by clearly communicating available AI services, policies, and responsible-use expectations.
- Enabled scalable self-service by directing users to appropriate tools, training, and support pathways.

### AI Technology Inventory and Adoption Framework *(exp. Q2 2026)*

A continuing institutional initiative supported by the **AI Services and Technology Innovation Committee** and **DXIHub (Hub of Digital Transformation and Innovation)**. This effort combines a campus-wide AI tools inventory with a scalable adoption framework to improve transparency, enable governance and compliance, and guide strategic, ethical integration of AI across administrative, technological, and operational systems.
