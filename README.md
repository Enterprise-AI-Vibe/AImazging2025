## TEAM AI – Digital Portfolio

This repository documents key initiatives delivered by the **Digital Transformation** team at [Technology Services](technology.fresnostate.edu) in support of [Fresno State](www.fresnostate.edu)’s responsible, scalable adoption of Artificial Intelligence for teaching, learning, and university operations.

*The work represented here reflects cross-campus collaboration and aligns with institutional priorities for security, governance, accessibility, and digital transformation.*

## AI Platforms & Tools

### Bulldog Genie

Evolved from an Alexa-style campus assistant into a GenAI-enabled, agentic infrastructure that supports institutional knowledge discovery, task guidance, and scalable service enablement. Bulldog Genie integrates enterprise systems, curated knowledge sources, and governance controls to deliver reliable, role-aware AI experiences for students, faculty, and staff.

*This platform serves as the foundational backbone for digital transformation agents such as **TechVisor** and **Eduvisor**, enabling consistent architecture, shared governance, and reusable AI capabilities across multiple institutional use cases.*

**Highlights of 2025**

- Expanded functionality, use cases, and adoption based on user feedback and evolving AI capabilities.
- Established a reusable GenAI infrastructure to support multiple digital transformation agents (e.g., TechVisor, Eduvisor).
- Implemented governance-aligned controls for trusted knowledge access and role-aware experiences.
- Built a scalable integration foundation to support secure, enterprise-grade AI services.
- Adopted cloud-native DevSecOps practices and automation to ensure repeatable deployments, security review workflows, and maintainable engineering operations.

## Strategy, Governance & Adoption

### FresnoState.ai Portal (www.fresnostate.ai)

Built as the institutional “front door” for AI at Fresno State, FresnoState.ai is a centralized portal that supports digital transformation by making AI services easy to discover, understand, and adopt responsibly. The portal connects governance, training, and tool access into a unified experience that scales across the campus community.

*Developed an institutional framework to guide responsible, scalable, and sustainable AI adoption.*

**Highlights**

- Centralized AI tools, documentation, and governance guidance into a single source of truth.
- Improved AI readiness through onboarding workflows, training resources, and adoption support.
- Increased transparency by clearly communicating available AI services, policies, and responsible-use expectations.
- Enabled scalable self-service by directing users to the right tools, training, and support pathways.

### AI Technology Inventory and Adoption Framework (exp. Q2 2026)

A continuing institutional effort supported by the **AI Services and Technology Innovation Committee** and **DXIHub (Hub of Digital Transformation and Innovation)** to operationalize responsible AI adoption at Fresno State. The initiative combines a campus-wide AI tools inventory with a scalable adoption framework to improve transparency, enable governance and compliance, and guide strategic, ethical integration of AI across administrative, technological, and operational systems.

## Change Management, Enablement & Self-Service

This workstream supports responsible, scalable adoption of AI tools through communications, training, onboarding resources, and self-service access models—helping faculty, staff, and students build confidence and competence using AI in daily work.

### Onboarding & Enablement Content (Campus-Facing)

Developed and maintained structured onboarding, guidance, documentation, and web resources to support safe and effective AI usage (including ChatGPT and other emerging tools).

### Scalable AI Self-Service Access (services.fresnostate.ai)

Implemented a centralized self-service and provisioning model to streamline access to approved AI tools while reinforcing governance expectations and reducing support overhead.

### Productivity Tool Rollouts & Adoption Support

Led institution-wide enablement efforts to improve productivity, writing quality, and digital fluency through:

- **ChatGPT (Faculty, Staff, & Students)** — Onboarding guidance, documentation, and responsible-use resources to support safe and effective adoption.
- **Microsoft Copilot** — Enablement and adoption support for AI-assisted productivity workflows across Microsoft 365 applications, aligned with secure use and governance expectations.
- **Google Gemini & NotebookLM** — Access rollout, guidance, and adoption support for emerging GenAI tools.
- **Grammarly (Faculty & Staff)** — Pilots, workshops, and support resources to enhance communication and writing efficiency.
- **Adobe AI** — Activation and enablement of AI-powered Adobe tools for creative, instructional, and administrative workflows.

Support included onboarding workflows, documentation, training sessions, communications, and ongoing enablement resources.

## Agentic AI for Digital Transformation

*These initiatives are **Agentic AI solutions** that support workflow optimization and service modernization through AI-guided task assistance, institutional knowledge retrieval, and scalable adoption patterns. They are designed to integrate with governance-aligned controls and shared infrastructure.*

### Eduvisor (Agentic AI for Academic Advising Exploration)

Explores AI-guided advising and student support workflows through structured assistance and knowledge access. Collaborated with campus partners (Sergio, Holly Jamieson, Imelda Basurto, Chris Cook) to define use cases, identify process improvement opportunities, and evaluate readiness for adoption.

### TechVisor (Agentic AI for Technology Guidance)

Explores AI-guided technology decision support and service advancement through scalable, consistent guidance for campus users. Partnered with Harry, Llharehn, and Kyle to develop use cases that improve service pathways, reduce support friction, and strengthen campus technology enablement.
